# Hotely Landingpage

[hotely-landing.netlify.app/](https://hotely-landing.netlify.app/)

**Technology used:**
- Gatsby (react static site generator)

**Linters:**
- eslint + prettier

**Styles:**
- Tailwind (older version - problem with purgecss not resolved)
- Custom SCSS where tailwind can't reach



My first project with gatsby and GraphQL. Static sites generator is wonderful tool when you need SEO and highscore in google insight. Images processing work flawlessly but...

Gatsby still has problems with compatibility. There are so many things that can break your app, it is terrifying that you can't foresee which addon or dependency tear the hairs out of your head
